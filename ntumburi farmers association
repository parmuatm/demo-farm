<h2 style="color:red;">2ND METHOD:ONION AND TOMATO FARMING</h2>
<h4 style="color:red;">ONIONS AND TOMATOES USING THE DRIP IRRIGATION </h4>
<p>when farming onions we have done soo much reserchs to come up with varius methods of farming onions using small scales and have come up with a method</p>
</hr>
<p>to some the method might seem as a burden but bet me once you try it its soo sweet</p>
<p>we do use the drips which have holes in them which is attached at the root of each onion </P>
<p>the holes releases drops of water at a time </p>
<p>this allows the soil to consume water slowly but efficiently</P>
<h4 style="color:blue;"> here are some samples of the drip method</h4>
